    <p>#Attempt the following:
        
        
        In a company an employee is paid as under: If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary. If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. If the employee's salary is input through the keyboard write a program to find his gross salary.
        
        
        Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are entered through the keyboard. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.
        
              
        
        
        
        Write a program to receive Cartesian co-ordinates (x, y) of a point and convert them into polar co-ordinates (r, φ- 9) Hint: r=Math.sqrt(x^2+y^2)and φ =Math.tan^-1 (y/X)
        
        Write a program to receive values of latitude (L1, 2) and longitude (G1, G2), in degrees, of two places on the earth and output the distance (D) between them in nautical miles. The formula for distance in nautical miles is: ** D = 3963 cos^-1 (sin L1 sin L2 + cos L1 cos L2 * cos (G2—G1) ) **
        
        Wind chill factor is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to wind. The wind chill temperature is always lower than the air temperature, and is calculated as per the following formula wef = 35.74 + 0,6215t + ( 0.4275t - 35.75) * v^0.16 _where t is the temperature and v is the wind velocity. Write a program to receive values of t and v and calculate wind chill factor(wef).
