        Write a program to receive Cartesian co-ordinates (x, y) of a point and convert them into polar co-ordinates (r, φ- 9) Hint: r=Math.sqrt(x^2+y^2)and φ =Math.tan^-1 (y/X)
        
        Write a program to receive values of latitude (L1, 2) and longitude (G1, G2), in degrees, of two places on the earth and output the distance (D) between them in nautical miles. The formula for distance in nautical miles is: ** D = 3963 cos^-1 (sin L1 sin L2 + cos L1 cos L2 * cos (G2—G1) ) **
        
        Wind chill factor is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to wind. The wind chill temperature is always lower than the air temperature, and is calculated as per the following formula wef = 35.74 + 0,6215t + ( 0.4275t - 35.75) * v^0.16 _where t is the temperature and v is the wind velocity. Write a program to receive values of t and v and calculate wind chill factor(wef).
